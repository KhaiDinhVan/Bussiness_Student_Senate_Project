Fortunately, we received a high score for milestone three and were only faced with a few challenges / errors to fix! The mistakes we fixed were our ‘grants’ because we implemented a comma combining them all, but instead we needed to separate them out (i.e individually to each user). We also changed our database name from ‘354groupb254’ to ‘354groupb2’ and lastly added data to the application_member table (a quick mix up where we just forgot to do one of the tables). We attached ‘ERD_updates.sql' document that provides ERD modifications &nbsp;we made so it displayed HBS thinking through our database. We really didn't make any ‘big changes’ from the original plan, we stayed the course and even checked in with Payton Klumpp (HBS President) to see his vision and our goals were still on the right path (he gave us a thumbs up). We also have attached the updated project plan that includes all of the completed work!&nbsp;</span></p></span><p>&nbsp;</p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>
